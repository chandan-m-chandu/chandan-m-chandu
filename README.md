<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chandan</h1>
<h3 align="center">Student specializing in VLSI </h3>

Final year ECE student at PES University.
As a senior student, I serve as student head at [SILICON](https://www.linkedin.com/company/100910379). (VLSI student body under Dept. of ECE, PES University).  

-  My expertise include ability to draft a RTL design, perform verification using layered testbench, synthesis for FPGA/ASIC. Having exposure to RTL-to-GDSII, I'm exploring Physical design.

-  My projects include; 
-         -> Implementing AXI4-Lite protocol for RISC-V and memory (Design & Verification).
-         -> Implementing Simon Cipher on FPGA.
-         -> Implementing BIKE on FPGA. (Capstone project to implement Code-based Post-Quantum cryptography).
-         -> Design of On-Chip Process sensors.
